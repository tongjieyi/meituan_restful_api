meituan_restful_api
===================

These works was union of meituan restful api. 
For personal study reason, I put my works here because meituan has changed this api and it has gone out of use. 

These codes were written by myself in several days, and they are my first attempt on nodejs coding. So, it may 
provide some meaningful thoughts to you, although some codes are raw and not pefect . 

It runs several months in product environment. After my left, no one could(would) maintance it.
Now the same function is achived with PHP.

These codes are only half of the work. On the other hand, it requires some data stored within mongodb in predefined
format. You should store meituan api in json format, and deploy your mongodb properly and provide correct parameters
in the config files for running the codes.

After above, you should install all the nodejs modules required using - npm install somemodule

Once you finished all these works, you can run it by: node app.js
